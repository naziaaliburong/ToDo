This is ToDo web app. On "/" route a signup/login form appears. On successful login the user is navigated to "/dashboard" which is a protected route means only logged in users can access the "/dashboard". The "/dasboard" shows an input, edit icon, and delete icon to add, edit, and delete ToDo item respectively. If you want to access "/dashboard" log in first.

When user click + button, he adds a list.

When user clicks edit icon, he gets navigated to /edit route which is also a protected route. After updating list he again redirects to /dashboard.

User can also delete list from /dasboard by clicking on delete icon.

The Screenshoots of the app are in Route.docx. Everything is visually demostrated there. 

Note: Deploy the backend for making the app functional, but first replace http://localhost:5000 with backend hosted URL. If you are in haste, just check screenshoots to understand the functionality.
